G_Login
=================




#### To-do
___

1. Grab user input from a post request and match it against what's in the DB
  1. Just about done with this current problem is redirecting the user after they login, could be the whole "sessions" part of a user login system
2. Add signup functionality



**Will have 3 pages**
1. Login
2. Signup
3. Logged in


Login in and signup could be the same page, just handled differently with rendering and based on the URL
